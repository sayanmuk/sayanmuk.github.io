<h3 align="center">Description</h3>
<p>
The course has two lectures and a computer lab each week. The computer labs introduce and use the R programming language to carry out hands-on experiments with probability theory and statistical inference. </p>
<p>	
This course introduces probability theory, a branch of mathematics that helps quantify and analyze expressions of uncertainty. The focus of this course is on the use of probability theory toward statistical inference. Key probability topics include (a) using distribution functions to express uncertainty about a random variable, (b) jointly expressing uncertainty about two or more related random variables, (c) derivations of conditional distributions to express uncertainty of one random variable given information about other related variables, (d) using limit theorems to approximate the distribution functions of random variables that could be expressed as the sum of other simple random variables. Additionally, the course introduces the basics of statistical inference built on the foundation of probability theory, using two complementary forms of logical reasoning: deductive (how probable is observation X given hypothesis H?) and inductive (how probable is hypothesis H1 relative to hypothesis H2 given observation X?).

This website https://sayanmuk.github.io/240.html provides detailed schedule information and will be used to post supplementary material (reading/video). Homework excecises, labs, and solutions will be posted on the Sakai site STA.240L.001.S22. 
R is installed on the university computers and is also freely available from http: //cran.r-project.org/. We shall use Zoom for office hours and ad-hoc meetings.</p>

<p> I have also posted in the syllabus below links to video lectures by
 Jonathan Mattingly and Joe Blitzstein that cover the lecture material
 as well. </p>

<p> For each lecture (typically one lecture will cover two classes). I
 have posted where the material is covered, links to
 videos covering the material, a short note on the key topics/ideas,
 in these lectures, and the homework. </p>


<H3 align=center>Grading</H3>
<p>
The course will have weekly homework assignments (30%), weekly lab works (10%), one midterm exam (30%) and a final exam (30%). The exams will be take home.
</p>

<p>  
There is a <a href="https://piazza.com/duke/spring2022/sta240/home">Piazza</a> course discussion page. 
Please direct questions about homeworks and other matters to that page. Note responses to the Piazza areoften 
quicker than email, and your classmates
may respond too, so that is a good place to start.
</p>
<p><em>Students with disabilities:</em> Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact the <a href="http://www.access.duke.edu/students/requesting/index.php" target="_blank">Student Disability Access Office</a> 
at (919) 668-1267 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations can be made.</p>



<p><em>Academic integrity:</em> Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and 
service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, respect, and accountability. Citizens of this community 
commit to reflect upon and uphold these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect 
and promote a culture of integrity. Cheating on exams and quizzes, plagiarism on homework assignments and 
projects, lying about an illness or absence and other forms of academic dishonesty are a breach of trust 
with classmates and faculty, violate the <a href="http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/resources/dcs"
					    target="_blank">Duke Community Standard</a>, 
	and will not be tolerated. Such incidences will result in a 0 grade for all parties involved as well as being reported to the <a href="http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct" target="_blank">Office of Student Conduct</a>. Additionally, there may be penalties to your final class grade. Please review the <a href="http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/resources/academicdishonesty" target="_blank">Duke&rsquo;s Academic Dishonesty policies</a>.</p>
	
	
<p><em>Support Services:</em> Duke has resources for us to help take care of our mental well-being. Please 
consider services through <a href="https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/caps"

The ARC offers free services to all students during their undergraduate careers at Duke
	to discover and develop their own academic strategy for success at Duke.</p>
