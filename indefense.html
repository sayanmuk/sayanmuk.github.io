\
We are deeply concerned by the Trump administration\'92s move to gag\
scientists working at various governmental agencies. The US government\
employs scientists working on medicine, public health, agriculture,\
energy, space, clean water and air, weather, the climate and many other\
important areas. Their job is to produce data to inform decisions by\
policymakers, businesses and individuals. We are all best served by\
allowing these scientists to discuss their findings openly and without\
the intrusion of politics. Any attack on their ability to do so is\
an attack on our ability to make informed decisions as individuals,\
as communities and as a nation. <br>\
\
If you are a government scientist who is blocked from discussing their\
work, we will share it on your behalf, publicly or with the appropriate\
recipients. You can email us at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:USScienceFacts@gmail.com"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
