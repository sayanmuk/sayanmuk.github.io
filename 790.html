Stochastic Processes on Manifolds, Varieties, and Sheaves

We will discuss how to place stochastic processes on geometric, algebraic, and topological objects.
We will mainly consider Brownian motion and Gaussian processes as example processes. We first go through the manifold case where we introduce the Eells-Elworthy-Malliavin formulation of lifting Brownian motion on manifolds and then discuss a SPDE formulation of Gaussian processes on manifolds that ensure the covariance function is positive (semi) definite. We then consider the case of algebraic varieties and adapt manifold models to the setting where there are singularities induced by algebraic structures. There is very little on stochastic processes on sheaves. We will consider some recent work where we consider   probability spaces as Grothendieck sites  on which Brownian motions are defined via sheaves.

I will try to make this short course as self-contained as possible. I am hoping knowledge of Markov chains and basic differential geometry is enough for a base requirement. >	
	
<b>Texts:</b><br>
	
<p>	
Probability and Statistics (3rd/4th Ed) by MH DeGroot and MJ Schervish.<br>
</p>	
<p>
Other books one can look at<br>
Probability, Jim Pitman<br>
Essentials of stochastic processes, 3rd edition, Rick Durrett <br>
Probability and random processes, Grimmett and Stirzaker<br>
One thousand exercises in probability, Grimmett and Stirzaker<br></p>

<p> I have also posted in the syllabus below links to video lectures by
 Jonathan Mattingly and Joe Blitzstein that cover the lecture material
 as well. </p>

<p> For each lecture (typically one lecture will cover two classes). I
 have posted where the material is covered, links to
 videos covering the material, a short note on the key topics/ideas,
 in these lectures, and the homework. </p>


<H3 align=center>Grading</H3>
<p>
The course will have weekly homework assignments (30%), weekly lab works (10%), one midterm exam (30%) and a final exam (30%). The exams will be take home.
</p>

<p>  
There is a <a href="https://piazza.com/duke/spring2022/sta240/home">Piazza</a> course discussion page. 
Please direct questions about homeworks and other matters to that page. Note responses to the Piazza areoften 
quicker than email, and your classmates
may respond too, so that is a good place to start.
</p>
<p><em>Students with disabilities:</em> Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact the <a href="http://www.access.duke.edu/students/requesting/index.php" target="_blank">Student Disability Access Office</a> 
at (919) 668-1267 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations can be made.</p>



<p><em>Academic integrity:</em> Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and 
service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, respect, and accountability. Citizens of this community 
commit to reflect upon and uphold these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect 
and promote a culture of integrity. Cheating on exams and quizzes, plagiarism on homework assignments and 
projects, lying about an illness or absence and other forms of academic dishonesty are a breach of trust 
with classmates and faculty, violate the <a href="http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/resources/dcs"
					    target="_blank">Duke Community Standard</a>, 
	and will not be tolerated. Such incidences will result in a 0 grade for all parties involved as well as being reported to the <a href="http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct" target="_blank">Office of Student Conduct</a>. Additionally, there may be penalties to your final class grade.
