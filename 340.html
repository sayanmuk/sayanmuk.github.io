<h3 align="center">Description</h3>
<p>
Official course catalogue description: Advanced introduction to basic, non-measure theoretic probability covering topics in more depth and with more rigor than MATH 230. 
Topics include random variables with discrete and continuous distributions. Independence, joint distributions, conditional
distributions, generating functions, Bayes’ formula, and Markov chains. Rigorous arguments are
presented for the law of large numbers, central limit theorem, and Poisson limit theorems. 
Prerequisite: Mathematics 202, 212, or 222. Not open to those who have taken Mathematics 230 or
Statistics 230.</p>

<p>
My view: This course introduces probability as an area of mathematics. By that I mean probability is 
not developed solely as a tool or language for coomputations and how it can be applied to other disciplines 
but as a basic element in mathematics. A key component of this course is to frame probability and randomness
in precise mathematical terms and understand what theorems and proofs for random objects mean.	
</p>
<p>As a statistician I will also highlight how probability is used to model random phenomena and make 
inferences from observations. Some of the fundamental mathematical results and tools we will consider 
include	law of large numbers, central limit theorem, random walks and branching processes.  We also develop
an intution for the both the infinite and the infinitesimal in the context of random processes.
</p>
<p>Contrast with 230: The goal of Math 230 is to develop compentence in probabilistic reasoning and using 
probability as a tool to solve problems and model random phenomena. Unlike 230, in this course abstractions and proofs 
will be central to the course. So it is a mater of taste and a matter of mathematical rigor in deciding between 
the courses.</p>

Other books one can look at<br>
Probability, Jim Pitman<br>
Essentials of stochastic processes, 3rd edition, Rick Durrett <br>
Probability and random processes, Grimmett and Stirzaker<br>

<p>	
We will use Meester for most of the course with the exception of Markov chains and hierarchical models. </p>

<p> I have also posted in the syllabus below links to video lectures by
 Jonathan Mattingly and Joe Blitzstein that cover the lecture material
 as well. </p>

<p> For each lecture (typically one lecture will cover two classes). I
 have posted where in both books the material is covered, links to
 videos covering the material, a short note on the key topics/ideas,
 in these lectures, and the homework. </p>


<H3 align=center>Grading</H3>
<p>
The course grade is based on two midterms (15%) each, homeworks (40%), and a final (30%). Your lowest homework score will be dropped, and the remaining
homeworks will carry equal weight in your final homework average.
</p>
<p> <em> Exams:</em> There will be two “take-home” midterms and a “take-home” final exam. You are free to
consult outside resources such as other texts or lecture notes, but you may not consult with any
person but me (honor code) – this includes posting to forums or message boards. You will be
given a common 24 hour window in which to complete the midterms, and a 48 hour window for
the final. Midterms will be held the Thursday/Friday of the x-th week and y-th week. The 
final will be due . Late submissions will not be accepted, except as
required by the <A href="https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/class-attendance-and-missed-work"> University Policy</A>.
</p>  

<p> <em> Homework:</em> There will be weekly homework (excepting midterm weeks) due on Fridays at 5pm
EDT, to be submitted via Gradescope. In Gradescope you must tag the pages of your uploaded
assignment with problem numbers. You should make sure your uploaded writeup is legible. You
will have all you need to know to complete the homework after the Thursday lecture of the
preceding week. You are free to collaborate with other students on the homework, but you must write 
up your own solutions, in your own words, and acknowledge your collaborators at the top. 
Late submissions will not be accepted, except as
required by the <A href="https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/class-attendance-and-missed-work"> University Policy</A>.
</p>  	
	
  
<p>  
There is a <a href="https://piazza.com/duke/fall/math340">Piazza</a> course discussion page. 
Please direct questions about homeworks and other matters to that page. Note responses to the Piazza areoften 
quicker than email, and your classmates
may respond too, so that is a good place to start.
</p>
<p><em>Students with disabilities:</em> Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact the <a href="http://www.access.duke.edu/students/requesting/index.php" target="_blank">Student Disability Access Office</a> 
at (919) 668-1267 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations can be made.</p>



<p><em>Academic integrity:</em> Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and 
service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, respect, and accountability. Citizens of this community 
commit to reflect upon and uphold these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect 
and promote a culture of integrity. Cheating on exams and quizzes, plagiarism on homework assignments and 
projects, lying about an illness or absence and other forms of academic dishonesty are a breach of trust 
with classmates and faculty, violate the <a href="http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/resources/dcs"
					    target="_blank">Duke Community Standard</a>, 
	and will not be tolerated. Such incidences will result in a 0 grade for all parties involved as well as being reported to the <a href="http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct" target="_blank">Office of Student Conduct</a>. Additionally, there may be penalties to your final class grade. Please review the <a href="http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/resources/academicdishonesty" target="_blank">Duke&rsquo;s Academic Dishonesty policies</a>.</p>
	
	
<p><em>Support Services:</em> Duke has resources for us to help take care of our mental well-being. Please 
consider services through <a href="https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/caps"

<p>
Another resource to manage your busy schedule is the Academic Resource Center 
<a href="https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/dukereach1" target="_blank"> DukeReach</a>.
The ARC offers free services to all students during their undergraduate careers at Duke
	to discover and develop their own academic strategy for success at Duke.</p>
